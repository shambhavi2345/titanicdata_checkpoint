The notebook contains several cells related to data analysis and processing. Here is a summary of the contents:
Skills Used as a Data Analyst
1.Data Wrangling:
  Used pandas to load, inspect, and clean the data, handling missing values, and converting or creating new features.
2.Data Visualization:
  Utilized matplotlib and seaborn to create various visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms, KDE plots) to explore and interpret data patterns and relationships.
3.Feature Engineering:
  Extracted meaningful features (like "Person," "Alone") to enhance the analysis and provide more insights into the dataset.
4.Statistical Analysis:
 Applied statistical knowledge to interpret the visualizations and identify patterns, trends, and significant factors affecting survival rates.
5.Problem-Solving:
  Applied logical reasoning and problem-solving skills to make decisions about handling missing data, creating new features, and selecting the appropriate visualizations.
6.Programming in Python:
  Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming, using libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform data analysis tasks.
7.Data Storytelling:
  Interpreted the data and visualizations to provide insights and communicate findings effectively

Key Insights from Titanic Data Analysis
Passenger Demographics:
Majority of the passengers were male (537), followed by females (271), and children (83).
A significant number of children were in the third class compared to the first class.

Age Distribution:
The average age of the passengers was approximately 29.7 years.
The age distribution is different across the classes: the first class follows a normal distribution, while the second and third classes have a skewed distribution with a peak around the age range of 20-30 years.

Passenger Class and Survival:
More males were present in the third class, while the first and second classes had a relatively even distribution between males and females.
The survival rate was higher in the first class compared to the third class, indicating that passengers in higher classes had better chances of survival.

Embarkation Points:
The majority of the passengers embarked from 'S' (Southampton), with fewer embarking from 'C' (Cherbourg) and 'Q' (Queenstown).
Most of the first-class passengers embarked from 'C', while most of the third-class passengers embarked from 'S'.

Family vs. Alone:
Passengers traveling alone had a lower survival rate compared to those traveling with family.
The dataset shows a notable number of passengers were traveling alone (categorized by no siblings/spouses or parents/children onboard).

Deck Analysis:
The cabins were located across various decks: A, B, C, D, E, F, T.
Passengers in the upper decks (A, B, C) had a higher survival rate compared to those on lower decks.

Factors Influencing Survival:
Passenger class and age were significant factors influencing survival. Older passengers and those in the third class had lower survival rates.
Women and children had a higher survival rate, especially if they were in first or second class.
